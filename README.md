# Case Study of an employee attrition
# Summary
    
The main purpose of this case study is to find the causes and associated factors to leave employees voluntarily from their job. This is a very serious matter for many companies because it wastes millions of dollars for hiring and training a new employee. Thus only the salary and position canâ€™t stop this problem. It is also related to the relationship of the manger, colleagues, health insurance, and so on. Hence it can be minimized but not 100% controllable. Even if they minimize this problem, they can save millions of dollars. For this study, I have downloaded the datasets from Vincent Tatan GitHub repository. In fact, these datasets have a full explanation of the factors and variables so we can go each and a specific point to extract more meaningful insights.
